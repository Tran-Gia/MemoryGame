This is a completely free Memory Match-a-pair fangame based on Starcraft.

Status: Work In Progress. Game is mostly stable now.

This is a very old college project of mine, so expect out-of-date codes.
It is now being updated to be on par with my vision, with knowledge I've learnt from working.


Next planned updates:

- Fix remaining bugs
- Add more units and possibly rework level design
- TBD
- ...
- Update .NET version for the project
- Add database
- Add campaign
